### Telerik UI for Windows Univeral on Windows IoT
(installed on Raspberry PI2)


This project demonstrates how easy it is to add an amazing UI to your Windows 10 IoT project using Telerik's UI for Windows Universal. Find the [accompanying blog post tutorial here](https://winplatform.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/telerik-universal-on-raspberry-pi2/).



### Prerequisites:
**Windows 10 IoT**
You can run this on any of the Windows IoT devices. However, since it is a UI based project, I chose Raspberry PI 2 which has an HDMI out. 

[Go here to select your device and download Windows 10 IoT](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/GetStarted.htm). You will also find comprehensive instructions based on your device. 



**Windows 10 SDK**
You will need v10240 (or greater) of the Windows 10 SDK. If you did not select it when you installed Visual Studio 2015, you can use the [standalone SDK installer found here.](https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/windows-10-sdk)



**Telerik UI for Windows Universal**
You'll need to have UI for Windows installed. It can be a trial or dev license. [Download UI for Windows Universal from here](http://www.telerik.com/windows-universal-ui) and find the [full documentation here](http://docs.telerik.com/windows-universal/index).
